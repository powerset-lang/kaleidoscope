Code structure planned:
src/
    kaleidoscope.cc - contains main(), command line argument parsing, and either launches the REPL or the batch-mode compiler with the specified mode.
    repl.cc - can use directives (what metasyntax?) to set the mode of the repl, which then passes each line independently to the batch compiler in the current mode.

Modes are:
lex
parse
codegen
obj
exe

Should there be a "debug level", or specification of where to put debug output?


Factor apart user interaction into the 'ui', including repl. The UI drives creation of a 'compiler' object, which holds state/settings for the compiler. In the UI, the REPL issues the input string to the compiler as a standalone input, perhaps creating a new compiler each time around. REPL definitely can change the settings of the compiler(s) it is using/creating, such as the mode (lex/pars/etc).

Now, there are 2 headers to solve communication in both directions between the UI and the compiler.
- compilesettings.hh : class CompileSettings : "Downward commands", or the current settings as given by the user in the REPL/cmd line options.
- uicmd.hh : class UiCmd : "Upward commands", or how the compiler units communicate upward, including error messages and desired changes to settings.
This allows some semblance of separation between actual logic and interaction stuff... (kind of like model-view-controller? more like just model-view?)
